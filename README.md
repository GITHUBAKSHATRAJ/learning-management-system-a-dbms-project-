# Learning Management System (LMS) - Maven Project

## Overview

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of educational courses, assignments, and student data. The system is built using Java, Maven, and various web technologies, including Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and EL. The LMS allows admins to manage students, courses, and assignments efficiently while providing users (students) with a platform to access their courses and assignments.

## Features

1. **Manage Users:**
   - Add new students to the system.
   - View and edit student profiles.
   - Delete student accounts.
2. **Manage Courses:**

   - Assign students to specific courses.
   - View course details such as name, description, and enrolled students.
3. **Manage Assignments:**
   - Create assignments for courses.
   - Set deadlines for each assignment.
   - Grade student assignments and provide feedback.
4. **View Reports:**
   - Generate reports on student performance and course completion.
   - Track student activity and assignment submission status.
5. **Course Enrollment:**
   - Manage student enrollments in various courses.
   - Approve or reject student enrollment requests.

### User Features:

1. **View Courses:**
   - Browse a list of available courses.

5. **Submit Assignments:**
   - Upload assignments by the set deadlines.
   - Receive feedback from the admin after grading.
6. **Update Profile:**
   - Update personal information such as contact details and profile picture.

## How It Works

1. **Admin Login:**
   - Admins log in using their credentials to manage users, courses, and assignments.
2. **User Login and Registration:**
   - Users (students) can register and log in to the system to access their courses and assignments.
3. **Course Management:**
   - Admins create courses, which are then available for students to browse and enroll in.
4. **Assignment Management:**
   - Admins can create assignments and assign them to specific courses, which are then visible to the enrolled students.
5. **Student Dashboard:**
   - Once logged in, students are directed to a dashboard where they can view their enrolled courses, assignments, and grades.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java (Servlets, JSP, JSTL, EL)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing user data, courses, assignments, etc.)
- **IDE:** Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA (for development)
